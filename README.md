Sublime Text Color Scheme RSE
=============================

This is Ralf S. Engelschall (RSE)'s discreet color scheme for the
Sublime Text editor (http://www.sublimetext.com/). It uses just 4
colors: "white" for the background, "black" as the default text color,
"blue" for all language constructs (keywords and punctation characters)
and "brown" for all literals (strings, numbers, etc). Nothing more,
nothing less! Use this in combination with the great "Soda Light" theme
and the awesome DejaVu Sans Mongo font. For this, use Package Control to
install "Theme - Soda" and "Color Scheme - RSE", install the DejaVu font
set from http://dejavu-fonts.org/ and then use the following Sublime
Text 2 user preferences and you get a very elegant coding environment:

    {
        "theme": "Soda Light.sublime-theme",
        "soda_classic_tabs": true,
        "color_scheme": "Packages/Color Scheme RSE/RSE.tmTheme",
        "font_face": "DejaVu Sans Mono",
        "line_padding_bottom": -2,
        "line_padding_top": 0
    }
